# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js Express.js applications: unhandled promise rejections within route handlers.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, where an asynchronous operation lacks comprehensive error handling.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling to prevent unexpected application crashes.

## Problem

Unhandled promise rejections can lead to application instability and make debugging difficult. In this example, an asynchronous operation within an Express.js route handler might throw an error, but the error is not properly caught, resulting in an unhandled rejection that terminates the process unexpectedly. 

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that all asynchronous operations within route handlers are properly handled using `.catch()` to gracefully handle potential errors.  The example demonstrates the use of `try...catch` to handle errors that might occur during the asynchronous operation, as well as within the `.catch()` block of the promise itself for an even more robust handling of errors.  This approach prevents unhandled rejections and provides more informative error messages, enhancing application stability and making debugging easier.
